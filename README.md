# Node Playground

A playground for all things Node.js. This includes:
- Vanilla HTTP Web Server
- Framework HTTP Web Server, i.e. express, fastify, etc.
- Framework GraphQL Server
- Database connections
- Microservices
- Utility Scripts
- and more...

This one should cove a wide spectrum. We strive to do everything in TypeScript as we believe it is here to stay and just lets us write better code.

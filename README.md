# Node Playground

A playground for all things Node.js. This includes:

-   Vanilla HTTP Web Server
-   Framework HTTP Web Server, i.e. express, fastify, etc.
-   Framework GraphQL Server
-   Websockets
-   Database connections
-   ORMs
-   Microservices
-   Utility Scripts
-   and more...

This is a monorepo with various projects that helps me test different architectures, projects, libraries, etc.

It's a messy repo and it's meant to serve as a personal scratchpad for learning purposes. Feel free to clone, edit, contribute or whatever you want to do.

This one should cove a wide spectrum of topics

## Setup

It's setup as a monorepo using pnpm because I don't like having a million different repos. There is a main project at root which you can simply use as a template for new projects.

Each project is running SWC as a TypeScript compiler targeting CJS. You can of course change this to your needs.

Go play, have fun and learn.
